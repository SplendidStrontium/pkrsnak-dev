I'm Paige Krsnak, currently studying physics. My interests lie in astrophysics research, and I'm working on a project to study how black holes influence star formation rates in dwarf galaxies within the Sandra simulation.

This site will eventually house my CV, research projects, and other professional updates.

You can reach me at paige.krsnak50@student.qcc.cuny.edu or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/SplendidStrontium).
